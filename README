This is an implementation of a portion of the Matrix Client-Server protocol, from the client-side only. The specification can be found at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.6.0

In order to test this client, you will need to set up a Matrix homeserver. You can find one such distribution at https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse

Follow the directions in the Synapse repository to set up a local homeserver. During my testing, I followed the "Synapse Development" section.

To use the client:
From the top level of the project (where this README is located) execute:

python3 -m src.app.client <homeserver-listener>

where <homeserver-listener> is the endpoint where your homeserver is listening, not the "name" of the homeserver. 
This is important because when I set up a local homeserver for basic HTTP use, I specified a homeserver "name" of localhost:8080, but the default configuration set up the HTTP listener at port 7680. 
I'm not sure why it started listening on a port 400 numbers below the port in the name it was given. Suffice it to say, the listening port is not the same as the homeserver "name."

A single client session begins with a login and ends with a logout. You can optionally pass a --register flag to tell the client to register your user with the homeserver first:

python3 -m src.app.client <homeserver-listener> --register

In either case, you will be prompted for a username/password login. If login is successful, you will be able to enter commands through standard input.

Commands:
logout - Logs out session and ends client process
createroom <room-name> - Creates a room on the homeserver
joinroom <room-name> - Join a room on the homeserver
send <room-name> <message> - Send a message to a room
